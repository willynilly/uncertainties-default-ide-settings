# Instructions for VSCode

1. If you don't have a .vscode folder, create a .vscode folder in your project
2. Copy vscode_default_settings/settings.json.default to your .vscode folder in your project.
3. If you don't have a settings.json file in your .vscode folder, rename settings.json.default to settings.json
4. If you already have a settings.json file in your .vscode folder, you can copy whichever settings you like from settings.json.default to settings.json
